# Better Worldgen
Minecraft datapack mod that allows for better world generation.

- Moderately amplifed world. Trying to move away from Minecraft's FlatCraft(TM) world generation. Maybe that was cool in 1.6 Beta, but it doesn't fit with the increased height and depth limits available in 1.18+
- Better village structures
- Updated and improved Vanilla biomes
